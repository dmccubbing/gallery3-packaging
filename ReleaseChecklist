Release Checklist
-----------------

All the instructions below refer to the version of the code in the
appropriate release branch.  The expectation is that the master branch
is where main development happens and that we'll have a branch for
each individual major release version:

 >--+----------------+--------------------------> master
    |                \----*----------> 3.1.x
    |                     3.1
    \----*----------*------------*-------> 3.0.x
         3.0        3.0.1        3.0.2

The git based instructions below all refer to operations in the
RELEASE BRANCH.

1) Notify gallery-redistributors list of upcoming release

2) Make sure all unit tests pass.  You can check Travis:
   https://travis-ci.org/gallery/gallery3/branches

3) Update the gallery3 VERSION constant in gallery3/modules/gallery/helpers/gallery.php
   if necessary.  Typically, this version should be updated long before release so
   that users can track which version they're using.

4) Look over gallery3/README and touch up anything version specific

5) Tag the release, eg:
   $ git tag 3.0.2
   $ git push --tags

6) Build the release, eg:
   php build.php 3.0.2

7) Upload file to SF.net

8) Create a forum topic for the release, leave it unpublished.

9) One final pass over the GMC news story, make sure the download link is correct.

10) Click "publish" on the GMC story and the forum topic

11) Update http://galleryproject.org/admin/build/block/configure/block/1

12) Update the release date on the Codex on http://codex.galleryproject.org/Downloads and
    http://codex.galleryproject.org/Main_Page

13) Update the 3 release_xxx fields on http://galleryproject.org/admin/gmc_versioncheck --
    all the rest should be fine.  The branch entries are updated automatically.

14) Close the old milestone, create a milestone for the next release,
    create a version for the milestone just closed and make it the
    default, make the new milestone the default.

15) Update the topic on IRC

16) Update sf.net, freshmeat.net, opensourcecms.com stories
